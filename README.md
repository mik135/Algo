**This repository contains a function "sen" that returns a object when passed a string.**

### How to use

There are three methods available within the function: 
- len: *returns the length of a sentence*
- numWord: *returns the number of words in a sentence given they are separated by a single space*
- numVowel: *returns the number of vowels in a sentence*

```javascript
    const sentence = sen("A very very long sentence.");

    sentence.numWord();
```

The above code will return **5** as that is the number of words in the sentence.
